# 22B Terminal for Gradient Descent in Mothership: Warden Notes

## Login and Password Information

Use the following login and password info to access the full contents of the terminal. They are in the format of username:password and can be used via `login username:password`.

### emily:hunter2
* password can be found in the chat logs while logged in as a guest
* accessing this login grants players access to the guestmap function, which in my game is a handout of floor 1
* additional mails and chat logs include some flavor text

### admin:trustno1
* password is intended to be found in-game, ideally somewhere on floor 1
* grants access to a security overide that disables the turrets in security checkpoint Alpha and Bravo
* grants further map access, which in my game I took to mean a limited map of floor 2

## Other commands

This is a list of some other commands and their intended function in game. Don't feel restricted to what I have here!

### ping
* a simple function to ping other devices on the network
* currently doesn't do much, but I am curious to add to it later - what if players ping the troubleshooters, for instance?
* if the players attempt to ping `monarch` or `Monarch` they recieve a warning. In-game, I add 1 stress to Monarch.

### admin.exe
* this is a trap setup by Monarch, results in a brainscan when run
* the `help` message is intended to be a warning left by a previous diver
